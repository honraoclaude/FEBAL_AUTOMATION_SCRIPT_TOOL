# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-11)

**Core value:** Autonomous discovery — point the platform at a URL with credentials and it maps the application, learns its workflows, and builds the knowledge graph by itself.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Foundation & Dev Environment

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 11 (Foundation & Dev Environment)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-06-12 -- Phase 1 planning complete

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 11-phase vertical-slice structure adopted from research dependency spine (Foundation → LLM Gateway → Tracer Bullet → Explorer → KG → Generation → Execution → Healing → Defect+Jira → Dashboards → Hardening)
- [Roadmap]: Staggered infra activation — Phase 1 runs only Postgres + Redis; Neo4j enters Phase 3, RabbitMQ/MinIO Phase 7, Elasticsearch Phase 9/10, Prometheus/Grafana/K8s Phase 11
- [Roadmap]: LLM gateway with budgets/kill-switch built BEFORE any agent (Phase 2) so no agent can spend unmetered money
- [Roadmap]: Trust gates are phase launch requirements — draft-mode Jira, heal audit trails, ground-truth harnesses (QUAL-01/02/03 mapped to Phases 5/8/9)
- [Roadmap]: REQUIREMENTS.md actually contains 57 v1 REQ-IDs (initial count of 49 was incorrect); all 57 mapped

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 4]: Most novel component (perception prompts, state-abstraction fingerprints, action risk heuristics) — plan with `--research-phase`
- [Phase 5]: Cypher schema + reconciliation strategy synthesized from research, no canonical reference — plan with `--research-phase`
- [Phase 8]: Similarity scoring weights/thresholds need experimentation — plan with `--research-phase`
- [Phase 9]: Confidence calibration methodology + hand-rolled ADF generation (no Python ADF library) — plan with `--research-phase`
- [General]: MFA/SSO target-app auth is a known limitation (v2 EXT-04); demo targets don't exercise it
